# üìÅ File Management
It's simple. There are no complicated functions.It's currently in alpha, so all you have to do is import files included in BCH+.<br>
You cannot upload files yourself (this is restricted due to insufficient disk space on the rental server).<br><br>

Currently you can import:
- Append
- MS-Copilot
- ChatGTP
- Startbootstrap-personal
- Constra-bootstrap-vsc
- Star-admin2
- Light-bootstrap-dashboard
- Bootstrap-dashboard-2.1.1-vsc
- Material-dashboard
- CoolAdmin-master

These 10 themes passed the test.<br><br>
In addition to the above, I have also downloaded Argon-dashboard-master, Awesome-dashboard, ChocoCake_template, Datta-lite, Ogani-master,
Pizza_template, Darkpan-1.0.0, Stream-dashboard, Portal-v3.0, Hybrid-admin, Sb-admin2, Bootstrap-admin-Codex,
Flat-able-lite, universal-3-0-2, and quixlab-bootstrap-main, but each of them has some kind of issue.<br><br>
I will test them one by one (I tested them a long time ago and haven't seen them since, so some may pass now) and add the ones that pass.

### Importing a File
Simply select a template from the dropdown menu and click the Import button.

The following four operations are available for imported files:
- Move to Trash
- Restore from Trash
- Convert to Project
- Delete from Trash

The "Move to Trash/Restore from Trash/Delete from Trash" operations work the same as the Windows Recycle Bin.

### Change to Project
It's the same with bakeries, but no one does everything by themselves.
For example, roles are divided so that a designer creates the HTML templates and a programmer does the coding.<br>

If you simply import it, it will remain personal data. In other words, only you can see it.
If you change it to a project, you can share it with other team members. For example, a designer can upload an HTML file
and give access to it to a programmer. The programmer can convert it into a template, check the contents, and copy them if they're OK.

The folder name will be "Original folder name PRJ-Email address". For example, Append PRJ-kai999@gmal.com.<br><br>
Since project members know each other's email addresses, I don't think there's any problem with displaying the administrator's email address.
Currently, it's not possible to preview the converted template, but if you could, you could give clients access rights and let them see the finished product.<br><br>
Files that have been converted into project files cannot be changed back to personal files.<br>
For information on controlling access rights, see User Management.
