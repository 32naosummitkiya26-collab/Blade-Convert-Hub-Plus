# Importable samples

I was actually planning to release it once I had completely converted 50 themes by different authors. I thought that if I could get that far, I would be able to absorb the quirks of various writing styles. However, I'm only developing this as a hobby, and I don't use the templates converted with BCH+ in actual development, so I can't judge whether or not it will be useful to the public.
I wanted to hear whether BCH+ is an app that everyone will support, so I decided to release it even though it's incomplete.

・Append (5 files)

I also downloaded about 15 other random themes (200 files total), and will test them one by one and add the ones that work well.
